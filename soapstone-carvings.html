            How to carve soapstone
        </h3>
        <p>
            Carving soapstone is a fairly easy and forgiving process. Soapstone is soft enough to be easily carved with
            hand tools, and it polishes up nicely. You can find soapstone at most rock shops, or online. Here are the
            basic steps for carving soapstone:
        <ul>
            <li>Choose your stone. Pick a piece of soapstone that is the size and shape you want your finished carving
                to be. If you're not sure, it's always better to start with a smaller piece – you can always carve more
                off later, but you can't add back on!
            </li>
            <li>Sketch your design. Use a pencil to sketch your design onto the soapstone. Keep it simple to start with
                – remember, you can always make it more complicated later.
            </li>
            <li>Start carving. Use a hammer and chisel to start carving out your design. Go slowly and carefully at
                first, until you get a feel for how the soapstone responds to your tools.
            </li>
            <li>Finish up. Once you're happy with your carving, use a piece of sandpaper to smooth out any rough edges.
                If you want a high-gloss finish, you can buff the soapstone with a soft cloth.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
