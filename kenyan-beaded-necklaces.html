            outfit. But how do you wear one? Here are some tips:
        <ul>
            <li>Choose the right length. A Kenyan beaded necklace should sit at the base of your neck, just above your
                collarbone. If it's too long, it will look like a costume necklace. If it's too short, it won't make
                much of an impact.

            <li>Pair it with the right outfit. A <a

                patterns or prints.
            </li>
            <li>Consider the occasion. A Kenyan beaded necklace is a bit dressier than your average piece of jewelry, so
                it's perfect for special occasions or nights out. Save it for when you really want to make a statement.

                One of the most popular pieces of jewelry in Kenya is the beaded necklaces. However, these necklaces are
                not as durable as they may appear. The beads and wire can break easily, so it's important to take care
                when wearing and storing them. If you're looking for a beautiful piece of jewelry to add to your

                often made of materials that can cause reactions in people who are sensitive to them. In addition, the
                necklaces are often made with string that can also cause reactions. If you are unsure whether or not you
